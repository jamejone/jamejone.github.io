Like many folks finding their way through the COVID-19 pandemic, I've [recently accepted a job](https://twitter.com/james_output/status/1320110838792003584) working permanently remote. So for the foreseeable future my workstation will be pulling double-duty for macOS-based software development with a MacBook Pro and Windows-based gaming on a PC.

Modern monitors come with a lot of interesting features. Did you know you can connect a MacBook to a monitor using a single USB-C cable and transmit USB, power, audio ***and*** video?

Unfortunately, it's not as simple as simple as knowing whether a monitor supports USB-C. Many monitors support USB-C but don't have any sort of way to pipe the audio out from the monitor (for example, to a sound bar). And some monitors have USB-C and audio out, but only provide 15W of power.

So I set out to identify a monitor that meets all of my criteria. Specifically:

* Has a built-in KVM switch that lets me easily switch between my PC and my MacBook.
* Provides at least 60W power over USB-C (the bare minimum to power a 16-inch MacBook Pro).
* Some sort of audio output (almost always analog).
* Upstream USB-B Port so that I can plug my keyboard and mouse into the monitor and pipe PC audio through monitor to the sound bar.
* VESA mountable.
* 27" 1440p. Good for gaming and happens to be [the ideal non-retina DPI for macOS](https://bjango.com/articles/macexternaldisplays/).
* IPS panel. The viewing angles on my TN panel are so bad it interferes with my work so IPS is a must.

Nice-to-haves:

* Adaptive sync (AS).
* 144hz refresh rate. At 60hz I lose track of my mouse cursor in League of Legends and we can't have that!
* 90W power delivery over USB-C.
* 34" 1440p ultrawide (basically the same vertical height and DPI as a regular 27" widescreen). A pure retina display like a 27" 5k would also be acceptable, though I couldn't find one that meets all the minimum criteria.
* Reasonable price.

Here's what I found after about 15 hours of research:

Model | Pros | Cons
----- | ---- | ----
ViewSonic VP2771 | 27" 1440p, $200-$450 | 60hz, 60W USB-C
LG 34WK95C-W | 34" 1440p UW, AS | 75hz, 60W USB-C, ~$1,000
Dell U3421WE | 34" 1440p UW, 90W USB-C | 60hz, ~$1,000
LG 34WK95U | 34" 5k UW, 85W USB-C | 60hz, ~$1,300, awkward DPI
Dell U3219Q | 32" 4k, 90W USB-C | 60hz, ~$800, awkward DPI
BenQ PD3220U | 32" 4k, 85W USB-C | 60hz, ~$1,200, awkward DPI
Razer Raptor 27 | AS, 144hz, HDR | 15W USB-C, No VESA mount
Philips 346B1C | 34" 1440p UW, 90W, AS, $450 | 100hz, VA panel
Acer Predator X34 S | 34" UW, **200hz** AS, 85W USB-C | Not available yet

I can't guarantee this is an exhaustive list, but it might be. I left off monitors that are no longer for sale or lack crucial features like an audio output or upstream USB-B port.

As you can see, there's no ideal monitor except for the Acer Predator X34 S, which [isn't available in the US yet and currently costs Â¥9999](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-predator-x34-s-a-34-inch-200hz-nano-ips-curved-monitor-w-05ms-response-time) (roughly $1,500). In terms of what's available today, you ultimately need to choose whether you want to sacrifice refresh rate, VESA mounting, USB-C charging, or panel type.

As luck would have it, I ended up snagging a ViewSonic VP2771 on eBay for $200 shipped. After all, I still have a 144hz TN panel that I can keep plugged into the gaming PC. It's not ideal but it'll work until I get my hands on that Acer.

Let me know in the comments if you find a monitor that should be in this list. If you want to play League of Legends together you can find me under the summoner name JamesJonesJrJr.

Stay safe out there, friends.
